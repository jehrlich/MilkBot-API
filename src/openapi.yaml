    ## MilkBot Fitting
    This service uses the MilkBot fitting engine to fit the MilkBot
    model to lactation data. The
    returned parameter set can be substituted into the MilkBot
    equation<br><br> ((1 - E^((offset - t)/ramp)/2)*scale)/E^(decay X t)
    <br><br>to generate predicted milk production at any time in the lactation,
    where t is time since calving (in days, DIM=0 at calving) and E is Euler's
    number.<br><br> Simple formulas described at the support URL can calculate
    persistence, M305, or cumulative milk between dates. For a fuller description of 
    the model see [Quantifying inter-group variability in lactation curve shape and 
    magnitude with the MilkBotÂ® lactation model](https://peerj.com/articles/54/)
    ## API Keys
    To use this service, a valid API key must be in a `X-API-Key` header of each request. 
    For a free API Key, contact Jim Ehrlich jehrlich@MilkBot.com
    ## Priors Tree
    The fitting process uses Bayesian prior expectations as the expected means and standar deviation of
    parameter values as well as expected sd of fitting error. If priors are
    provided, they will be used. Otherwise default values based on breed and
    parity will be used. Use `GET /priorsTree` to see default priors.
    The PriorsTree uses a `discriminator` at each node to match lactations to an appropriate
    `Priors`. 
    ## Customizing
    - **Priors** It is easy to generate a customized PriorsTree by fitting a training set of lactations,
    then using the averages from that set as the priors for future fittings.  
    - **Options** The optional `Options` object may be included with a `FittingJob` to control what
    data is returned.
    - **Milk Units**  Milk values may be in Kg (the default) or pounds (by specifying "milkUnit": "Lb")
    ## Data constraints
    - Fitting Jobs may exceed the maximum memory available to the fitting function. If that becomes a problem
    please contact us and we will consider increasing the memory pool. A Workaround is to fit in small batches or 
    as individual lactations.
