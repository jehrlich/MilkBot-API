<h1>MilkBot-API</h1>
        <p>The MilkBot lactation model is a nonlinear lactation model describing daily milk production as a function of time(days) since calving (DIM). It is parameterized so that fitted parameter values are can be interpreted as observable features of the lactation as a whole.<br>

        <ul >
            <li><strong><em>scale</em></strong>, the overall level of milk production</li>
            <li><strong><em>ramp</em></strong>, governs the rate of the rise in early lactation</li>
            <li><strong><em>decay</em></strong> is the rate of exponential decline, most apparent in late lactation</li>
            <li><strong><em>offset</em></strong> is a small (usually insignificant) correction for time between calving and the theoretical start of lactation</li>
            <li><strong><em>t</em></strong> is time since calving in days (DIM)</li>
        </ul>
        <p dir="auto">An open-access paper in <strong><em>PeerJ</em></strong> provides a good introduction to the model.

        <p dir="auto">Because it is a nonlinear model, fitting is not straightforward. We have developed and
            <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030212003815" rel="nofollow">validated</a> a Bayesian
            fitting engine that estimates fitted parameter values from a set of expected values (the priors)
            and any number of data points.</p>
        <p dir="auto">This <a href="http://jehrlich.github.io/MilkBot-API/openapi.html" rel="nofollow">API</a> describes the API for a planned public service for access to that fitting process.</p>
               <p dir="auto">This API is under development and open for comment and suggestions. When some consensus
            has been achieved on a workable API, the fitting engine will be ported to this API.</p>
