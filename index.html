<p>
	This is a project to develop technology to quantify both <strong>magnitude</strong> and <strong>shape</strong> 
	of lactation curves in a consistent and repeatable way.  It is based on the simple observation that lactation 
	curves vary, in consistent patterns, no doubt influenced by genetics, environment, and health. Tools for
	 characterizing that variation are 	likely to be useful in understanding many problems in dairy herd management 
	 and dairy research.
</p>
<p>Variability in lactation curves may be characterized by three observable characteristics of the curve
	plotting milk production against time for a lactation. These are
</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong><em>scale</em></strong>, the overall level of milk production</li>
<li><strong><em>ramp</em></strong>, the rate of the rise in early lactation</li>
<li><strong><em>decay</em></strong> the rate of exponential decline, most apparent in late lactation</li>
</ul>
<p>Using MilkBot technology, we can quantify these observable characteristics as  parameter
	values obtained by fitting production data from individual lactations to the MilkBot model. These 
	parameter values can be treated as individual metrics as described in the paper
	<a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.54">Quantifying inter-group variability in lactation curve 
		shape and magnitude with the MilkBotÂ® lactation model.</a> Applications tend to fall into 
		two classes, evaluating genetic merit of cattle, or evaluating the effects of management
		on production.</p>  

<p>
	There are two essential components to MilkBot technology.
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>The MilkBot Model</h3>
			This is a simple nonlinear algebraic model predicting daily milk production as a function of DIM and
			the four MilkBot parameters, <strong>scale, ramp, offset, </strong>and <strong>decay</strong>.  From fitted 
			parameter values it is easy to calculated daily production at any day in the curve, or M305, 
			persistency, peak milk, peak day, and several other metrics.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>The MilkBot Fitting Engine</h3>
			MilkBot uses a nonlinear model, so the common methods for fitting linear models do not work.
			We have developed an iterative Bayesian fitting engines	that can fit individual lactation using
			any number of data points yielding estimates of parameter values for that lactation. 
		</li>
		
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	We are currently developing a REST API to provide fitting services as described in this 
	<a href="/api/api.html">OpenAPI specification</a>. We invite comments or suggestions.
